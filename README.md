## About

This project provides a secure and educational tool for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Hill Cipher, a classical polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra. The repository includes both a Python backend implementation and a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Hill Cipher
- Customizable key matrix
- Web interface for easy interaction
- Input validation and error handling

## Demo

If you have a live demo, add the link here.  
Otherwise, you can add screenshots or gifs showing how to use the tool.

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emma157819/Hill-Cypher-Encryption.git
cd Hill-Cypher-Encryption
```

### Python Dependencies

If your project uses a requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Web Interface

Open `index.html` in your web browser, or follow instructions in the repo if using a backend server.

## Usage

- Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
- Provide a valid key matrix (must be invertible modulo 26).
- Click the appropriate button to encrypt or decrypt the message.

## How It Works

The Hill Cipher uses matrix multiplication to transform plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa. The key is a square matrix of numbers, and the text is divided into vectors, multiplied by the key, and then reduced modulo 26.

_For more details on the algorithm, see [Hill Cipher - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_cipher)._

## Technologies Used
